**profanity-block-list.txt** - list of words/phrases aimed to be blocked in civilized discussion. Some listed phrases are questionable for blocking. Some should be removed if you allow DMs/PMs which allows paed.philes and similar to get in contact on messenger like Sessi.n (search for dm, pm, message, msg, add, group, grp, room).

**session-sogs-prevent-disable-pm-dm-for-regular-users.sh** - Linux bash script to help SOGS admin to add or remove a database trigger that will prevent regular users without admin/mod privileges to send PM/DM to others.
